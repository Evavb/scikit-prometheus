scikit-prometheus
=================

We love `scikit-learn` as it makes it really easy to build interesting and useful ML models.
The goal of this project is to make it easy to add monitoring to your existing scikit-learn pipelines.
We do this by extending existing scikit-learn components and and build new ones that expose
`Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/>`_ metrics that keep track of, for example the model predict latency, histograms
of predict probabilities and many others.
